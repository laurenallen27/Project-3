Project 3: Module 
This module contains functions which manipulate ECG data recorded using Arduino and
wearable ECG sensors. The data is loaded into an array of a specified length, and filtered
using a bandpass butterworth filter. There are then functions which detect when heartbeats
occur, calculate a set of IBIs at evenly spaced intervals, and then calculate heart rate
variability. The interpolated IBIs are then tranformed into the frequency domain and plotted
in units of power with specified high and low frequency bands. Finally, the mean power
in these bands is extracted and used to calculate the LF/HF ratio, which will ultimately be 
used to estimate ANS activity.
